    description:
      "A production-ready multi-agent AI system built with LangGraph and LangChain that orchestrates specialised LLM agents through a stateful graph — each agent handling a distinct role in the reasoning pipeline. The system exposes a FastAPI backend (port 9999) and a Streamlit UI (port 8501), fully containerised with Docker and automated through a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline — demonstrating end-to-end agentic AI engineering from graph design to deployment.",
